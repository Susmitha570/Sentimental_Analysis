# Sentimental_Analysis
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning algorithms and Python. It uses pre-labeled text data to train a model that can predict the sentiment of new, unseen text. Sentiment analysis is the task of determining whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
Overview
In this project, we:

Load a labeled sentiment dataset (e.g., movie reviews, product reviews).
  Preprocess the text data by tokenizing and vectorizing the text.
  Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) on the processed data.
  Evaluate the model using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  Use the trained model to predict sentiment on new text.
  Requirements
  To run the code, you'll need the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
nltk (for text preprocessing)
